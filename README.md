### Overview

In this seminar series we are going to look at different sub-areas of Human-Robot Interaction. At each scheduled seminar, you will be given an introduction into the topic by myself and then we have three research papers, presented and discussed by the student, ie. you. In your presentation of the paper, make sure you cover

1. the aims and objective of the paper
2. the related work (identify in which way your paper is different to other approaches)
3. the main findings presented in the paper

In the discussion of the paper you should critically reflect on 

1. the relevance of the research presented (is it widely applicable or very specific? how does it fit into the context of the research field?)
2. the rigour of the work (are the results convincing? is the methodology sound?)
3. the originality (is it a new idea? is the approach novel? is it the application of well-established techniques for a new application area?)

This seminar series complements the [lecture on Human-Roboter Interaction](https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/human-robot-interaction/)

### Meetings for advice

My office is B114. Please [book an appointment](https://doodle.com/mhanheide) (usually half an hour should be enough) when you want to see me.

* [choose **another** paper](https://doodle.com/poll/wkkmzc2t3yrsd8sq) from the list to **DISCUSS** at the scheduled session.


#### 11/03/16: Introduction, History and Overview of HRI

In this session we look at general challenges of HRI, the overall aims and objectives of the field, and a little bit more in details where it originates from and what future challenges might be.
[Slides of Marc's presentation](https://github.com/marc-hanheide/SIA-HRI-16/raw/master/Slides/LaSapienza%20SIA%20HRI%201.pdf) are available.

#### 01/04/16: Studying and Measuring in HRI

The focus in this session is on methodology to study HRI. This is mostly about quantitative research methodologies, with links to research in sociology, human-computer interaction and psychology. We will look at different approaches to study specific aspects of HRI.

#### 15/04/16: Human-Robot Spatial Interaction

This session focuses on mobile robots and how they should be moving among humans. We will look at implicit signalling from motion, social- or human-aware navigation approaches, balancing (perceived) safety and effectiveness of navigation.
